# shop-aggregator-app

Overview: project to create application where you can shop various stores from one location

## Project Vision

A user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing shopping aggregator for stylish shoppers to search items across
curated stores with customizable filters.

Create a shopping search application where users:

- select their favorite shops (or choose founder mode to search by stores you personally like)
- search for items across selected websites
- uses filters like price, color, category
- enjoy an aesthetically pleasing, easy-to-use interface

### Why am I building this?

As someone who loves fashion and online shopping, I spend a lot of time searching through individual websites for
clothing items I am looking for. I keep a list holding all the different stores and boutiques I like to purchase from, so I figured why not create something that can help me save time by browsing all the stores in my list at once. This project aims
to let users shop across all of their favorite online shops from one convenient location, that is also aesthetically-pleasing
and easy to use.

## Goals

- Practice front-end and back-end development
